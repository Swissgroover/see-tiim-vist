## Idea of upgrading TAHVEL
​
Our goal is to upgrade the commonly used timetable of TAHVEL which has many disadvantages in terms of user-friendlyness, design, and functionality. The purpose of the project is to develop a better version of the TAHVEL, which would work both in the mobile device and desktop.

## What the upgraded TAHVEL is about?
Our version of TAHVEL has two different views:
1. student view
2. teacher view

Both of the views show the timetable of the ongoing week of your group (being a student) or your schedule (being a teacher), and in case you do not have a class during this week, the week of your next classes are shown.
