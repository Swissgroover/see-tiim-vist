## Idea of upgrading TAHVEL
​
Our goal was to upgrade the commonly used timetable of TAHVEL which has many disadvantages in terms of user-friendlyness, design, and functionality. The purpose of the project is to develop a better version of the TAHVEL, which would work both in the mobile device and desktop.
